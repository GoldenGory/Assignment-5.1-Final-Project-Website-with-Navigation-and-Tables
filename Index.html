Choosing the relation to this document as "stylesheet" enables me to use the css I had made.

Same as linking the javascript, but this will allow me to use javascript should I need it for this page in the future

     <div>
        <header>
            <h1>
                Welcome to my page!
            </h1>
        </header><!--
            <button></button> Is pretty much on the tin. Adds a button to press.
            The id for all these are different so I may change their looks apart from each other.
                           
            Reminder on how to ID:
            When I made these in the .css sheet, I typed:
            
            #button1{}
            #button2{}
            #button3{}
            
            I filled each {space} with the items I wanted to change, such as border or color.
                            
            Below, I link to another page I created in HTML in the last <button> tag.

                The <nav> is my navigation; where I want to stick all my navigation elements.
                    In this case I have all my elements on the top right of the page; using another id I could do
                    the opposite as well if I desired.
            -->

<center></center> This centers the text; Eventually I plan to have this done via css, but for now I use it as I'm comfortable with it.
<h1></h1> is a heading type text. Very big text!

Also, the id addition to lines I use in the rest of this document are merely for styling reasons.
These are made via the css stylesheet using #X, where X is the name I give the id.
Using these, I can make multiple different styles for different ids I would like to use.

After this <div> below, I use <img src="">, this allows me to link an image from either online or through my documents.
For the sake of this class, I linked from my own documents.

By adding style = "" to an html I can manipulate its style within html itself to a certain degree.
I use this to change the size of the waffle above my two buttons.
My two buttons both have functions on them, and I know that they both have music associated names, but that
is just because I began my music assignment beforehand. I'll make sure to edit everything out in the javascript
so you won't be able to overlap music, and also add different calls to functions depending on what assignment I'm 
submitting. I do apologize if it's a little confusing; just know that I can sniff through my work solidly. 
There's a method to my chaos.

Anyway, the start button will call my startMusic function from my script.
My stop button will call my stopMusic function from my script.
I lazily center them with <center> tags; they were leaning just a hair to the right and I couldn't be too bothered with it.

<!--
<br> Merely adds a break between spaces. 
This one below was used to seperate this <div> from the last <div>, leaving a nice gap.

The reason I do not seperate with <p> is because I accidentally made style properties for <p>
that would NOT have done well inside of this <div> ID. 
As such, I use <br> like <p> to seperate my paragraphs until I add an ID to <p> that will give me the same 
    text results as if it were on this <div> ID.

        the onclick = wafflesong() links to my function, which will create a new object when a user clicks the text element.
        (or whatever the function is linked to that has an onclick = "").
        In this case, I wanted the text to be a sort of cheeky easter egg type deal where if the user
        clicks on it, it will play the song the lyrics are from.

        I also have this type of function linked to the buttons above, where one can restart the page to stop it, but
        I figured since the text just changes here and the song is less than 40 seconds it truly didn't matter all too
        much. So long as a person isnt streaming my webpage or something, copyrights probably won't hit em.

        In addition, the text changes color on hover through the css file. Just for fun.

    <!--Below, I start a table. I've done this before, but I'll still explain it for myself and whoever wants to spot 
    my code walls.
    I give it the id of tablestag as this technically counts for the corder itself around the table. The <th> and <td> tags are
        inside of it which is why they werent really effected.
        If you look into the css I only really mess with the border radius to give it that curve. Same goes for greatwaffles.
        I'm leaving greatwaffles alone until I want to mess with it a bit later; I often find myself wanting to edit more
        at later dates, so that's just a service to myself at this point.
        
        Anyway. Below is the table where I list delicious pancake and waffle recipes I like.
        I ask that my whole table will only take up about 85% of the entire screen with width = "". 
        I ask my border = 4 px.
        
        To start with, I creat the <thead>, which is the headers for each column I wish to create. In this case,
            I create 5 to store some tasty items. I also ask that each column only take up 20% of the total width of my table.
            Then I add my columns. I could add a style tag for them like the lecture, but I found it was more fun to
            link it all to the stylesheets using ids.-->

<!--Below I finally create the body of my table. <tbody>.
    <tr> is my table row. I make 5 of them to match up with the <th> above, so it all lines up in the end.
        I add an id to my <tr> in order to get my :hover in css to work. I wanted some sort of interactive
            experience between the user and the table. I then make another table row <tr> to list the ingredients, and how to
                make the dish. This is a huge text wall, but that's all it really is until I finally say to end the tbody.
                In short: <tr> is a row that is horizontal. <td> is saying that I want to insert data in each spot between
                    my <th>, <col>, and my <tr> spaces. So basically, what I want to put inside my boxes.-->

I also add the image of our waffles that will fly across our screen. These guys are all stacked onto eachother.
I also have them sized a bit smaller than my previous waffle; this way it's not to detrimental for when users
want to click on something in the page. Sometimes 500 miliseconds of waffles flying to a corner of your page
might be just too long for some users.
